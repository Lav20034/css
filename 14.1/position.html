        <p class="passage">Hindus celebrate a lot of festivals and follow various rituals throughout the year, and Janmashtami is one of the most prominent festivals. Janmashtami is the festival of Hindus which is celebrated as the birthday of Lord Krishna. It is usually celebrated in the month of August. It is a major festival in Mathura and Vrindavan since it is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. People celebrate this day to enjoy the birth of Lord Krishna and adore him with all his favourite foods and take care of him like their own child. This day is not only celebrated in Mathura but in almost all parts of the country. People celebrate this day with a lot of devotion and happiness. People fast the entire day and engage themselves in decoration, games, dramas, songs, etc. Houses are decorated with flowers and rangoli to welcome the Bal Krishna. All the favourite foods of Lord Krishna are cooked and offered to him after his birth. People who fast do not eat or drink the entire day and wait for Bal Krishnaâ€™s birth at midnight. After the birth of Krishna, the mothers give a bath to the idols of Bal Krishna with milk and place him on the swing or jhula. They offer butter and other foods to him and put him to sleep. People engage in various activities and games like the Dahi Handi, where people compete to break the earthen pots and spill the curd inside it. Children are also engaged in dramas and act like Bal Krishna, and the history of his birth is portrayed in the act. </p>
